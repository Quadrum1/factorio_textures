# factorio_textures

## How to change your textures:

1. Navigate to: *Steam\steamapps\common\Factorio\data*
2. Drag and drop one of the resource folders called *base* or *core*
3. If asked, replace each file
4. Restart factorio, the textures should have been applied


## How do I revert back to the original textures?

1. Delete the textures that you change or just the whole folder containing the data*
2. Open Steam and Right-Click on Factorio in your library
3. Open *Properties*, goto *Local files*
4. Press *Check files for errors*
5. Steam will check for missing files and request new, original ones
